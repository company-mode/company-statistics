;;   (company-statistics-mode)
;;
;; Every time a candidate is chosen using company-mode, we keep track of this
;; (for a limited amount of recent choices).  When presenting completion
;; candidates next time, they are sorted according to the score thus acquired.
;;
;; The same candidate might occur in different modes, projects, files etc., and
;; possibly has a different meaning each time.  Therefore along with the
;; completion, we store some context information.  In the default (heavy)
;; configuration, we track the overall frequency, the major-mode of the buffer,
;; the last preceding keyword, the parent symbol, and the filename (if it
;; applies), and the same criteria are used to score all possible candidates.
